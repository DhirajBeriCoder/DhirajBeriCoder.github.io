</h1>

<p>

    Hi guys, welcome to the free digital mastery course 2020.

</p>

<p>

    My name is Dhiraj Beri, and I help students, experienced professionals and

    people looking for career change learn digital marketing for free. So that

    they can enhance their resume, get a job, and open up for ample

    opportunities.

</p>

<p>

    Who am I to even teach you digital marketing, right? After all, why would I

    teach you a 60,000 rupees course for free.

</p>

<p>

    Well, I've been doing this digital marketing for three plus years now. I

    have a portfolio of seven plus websites that drive good amount of visitors.

</p>

<p>

    Now comes the big question, what is digital marketing?

</p>

<p>

    In simple terms, digital marketing is all about driving more customers. Be

    it any product, all services, using these technologies primarily through

    the internet. There has been an exponential rise in the digital marketing

    jobs. More and more companies are using digital marketing to acquire new customers.

</p>

<p>

    Now, let's talk about how learning digital marketing can help you.

</p>

<p>

    Digital marketing is a skill that everyone must have. There are numerous

    benefits for everyone. You can easily get a job, you can even do a career

    shift, if you are not happy with your current work. You can even take

    freelancing work as well. You can become a full-time freelancer or do it

    part-time, for extra money. Now, this is especially good for college

    students who needed extra pocket money while practicing the newly learned

    DM skills. You can even enhance your resume by adding DM as a skill.

    Students, and even working professional can stand out among the rest of the

    competition in their interview by adding DM as a skill.

</p>

<p>

    If you are a small business or a start-up owner, or even planning to start

    a start-up, even then this digital marketing mastery course will help you

    immensely. Having the knowledge of digital marketing will be a key asset

    for you to grow your business. Trust me guys, this is a skill that will

    help you, one way or another.

</p>

<p>

    Now, let's talk about digital marketing jobs in India.

</p>

<p>

    Unlike the saturated and more competitive careers, digital marketing is a

    fairly new field. And it is expected to grow at a rapid pace. So how much

    do digital marketing jobs pay? It is one of the highest paid jobs in India.

</p>

<p>

    Now, I must mention that job is not the only way to make money through

    digital marketing. You can even start a business, just like me. Or you can

    even do paid consulting for the companies. Like I'm charging $100 - $200

    per hour for my personal coaching.

</p>

<p>

    And the best part is, you can even create a passive source of income either

    through blogging or affiliate marketing. We'll be talking all about this in

    the future blogs. Who can learn digital marketing?

</p>

<p>

    Well, you don't need any special qualifications. No technical background

    needed. All you need is one laptop or a computer and an internet

    connection, and that is all you need. Even a six-class student can start

    learning digital marketing.

</p>

<p>

    Few days ago, I saw a kid from USA who is 15 years old and he's in Facebook

    ad campaigns of hundreds and thousands of dollars. And he started to learn

    digital marketing when he was 13. So, if a 15-year-old kid from USA can do it, then you can do it as well.

    There's no age limit, no massive course fee, only your willingness to

    learn.

</p>

<p>

    What is the best way to learn digital marketing?

</p>

<p>

    Well, when I started, there was no one to guide me. No one to tell me the

    best tools, tips or strategies that actually work. Lucky for you, I'll be

    teaching you all of that. You need a guide, a person, who has made the

    mistakes so that you don't. Please don't spend 40, 50, or 60 thousand

    rupees on these digital marketing courses. Learn with all of us.

</p>

<p>

    We have an engaged community in our Facebook group, where you'll be

    learning with thousands of others and we'll also be providing you with

    bonuses, checklists, and worksheets.

</p>

<p>

    One big advice that I can give you, is that practical knowledge is what

    matters the most. So, don't just read the blogs lessons, but also take

    action. Complete all the steps, associated with each lesson to be able to

    actually learn it.
