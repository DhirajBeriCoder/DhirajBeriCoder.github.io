    Amazon affiliate marketing for beginners in 2020 (Part-3)
</h1>
<p>
    The best strategy is to first start a website, scale it, and then move to
    the various verticals of YouTube and Instagram. This has given me the best
    results. So, what is the process of making money from affiliate marketing
    through a website.
</p>
<p>
    Everything is explained in detail in our affiliate marketing course
    playlist. But right now, I’ll be giving you a general overview of how all
    these works. The process will be something like this. The first step is to
    do niche research. I will help you find a low competition and profitable
    money-making niche.
</p>
<p>
    Then in the next lesson I’ll share with you how to start a pro affiliate
    website. I’ll be sharing with you my tips, tricks and strategies that I’ve
    learned in the last 7 years of doing affiliate marketing. Also, I’ll be
    telling you the mandatory things that you need to follow so that your
    account doesn’t get banned.
</p>
<p>
    The third step is keyword research. I’ll share with you the exact strategy
    that I use to find low competition keywords that make you money not in
    years, but in months.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth step is to write articles. Either you can write it yourself, but
    I’ll also tell you how you can outsource it to someone else. I have spent
    thousands of dollars in knowing the best article structure. How many words
    your article should have? What should be the button color? I have tested
    everything.
</p>
<p>
    And I’ll be sharing the perfect article template with you in one of the
    lessons. The next step will be signing up to the Amazon Associate account.
    How to sign up? How to get approved? And how to not get banned. The next
    lesson will cover the most important detail.
</p>
<p>
    How to get your article on rank number one on Google search results. So,
    let’s say your website is about guitar and you write an article like “best
    guitars in India”. So, I’ll share with you all the strategies that I use to
    rank number one for my target keyword.
</p>
<p>
    And the last step is for you to send me a thank you email for introducing
    you to affiliate marketing. I would love to see some success stories if I
    like your site, I might even collaborate with you for other projects. So
    now let’s talk about money. How much many can you make?
</p>
<p>
    Now this depends entirely on you. How much time you are willing to invest
    on your website. The more time you invest, the more money you will be
    making. If you follow our complete playlist then I can tell you for sure
    that you will be making money in few months.
</p>
<p>
    In the beginning, it might look a bit complicated because you are new at
    this. But given a few days of implementing, you will become a pro. Once you
    scale the website, then you already know all the secrets. Then you can
    create many more websites, build a team, and scale even further.
</p>
<p>
    Like I started as a one-man-army, but today I have 9 full time people
    working on my affiliate websites. You are planting a tree. Once it’s grown
    up, all you have to do is spend a few hours on your website and it will
    keep giving you fruits for many years to come.
</p>
<p>
    Now let’s talk about common affiliate marketing mistakes. New affiliate
    marketers make these following common mistakes. Even I made them when I got
    started. The first mistake is not showing patience. You won’t start making
    money on day one. Rather, slowly and steadily you will be scaling.
</p>
<p>
    The second mistake is not implementing. Majority of you will just be
    watching the lessons, but very few of you will be actually implementing.
    But the people who implement, will be getting the best results. So, make
    sure you don’t just watch the lessons, but also implement everything I tell
    you.
</p>
<p>
    And not just implementing, you’ll be getting a lot of questions in your
    mind. So, don’t just implement, you can ask your questions in the Facebook
    group or you can also ask them in our YouTube live sessions. And I’ll try
    my best to answer all of you guys.
</p>
<p>
    Third mistake is getting greedy. Now few of you might watch our complete
    free affiliate marketing course playlist and then start implementing
    everything on multiple websites. If you’re a beginner or just starting out,
    even if you are an experienced affiliate, I would recommend you to open
    only one single website, and try to focus entirely on that.
</p>
<p>
    Your goal should first be able to create a website and scale it. Learn all
    the advance strategies, then build a team, and then open multiple websites.
    You don’t have to work hard, you have to work smartly. I have already made
    the mistakes, so you don’t have to make the same mistakes again.
</p>
<p>
    Rather follow the working strategies that actually work. One big advice
    that I can give to all of you is that practical is what matters the most.
    Don’t just watch the videos but also implement everything that I tell you
    in this free affiliate marketing mastery course.
</p>
<p>
    This is the right thing for you guys. Don’t be confused, I am here for you.
    I’m so happy to have a new member who will be our future success story.
    I’ll make sure that this journey of helping you, making money from
    affiliate marketing is fun, exciting and as easy as possible.
