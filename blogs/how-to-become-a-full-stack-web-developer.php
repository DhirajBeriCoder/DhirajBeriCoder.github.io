	<h2>
		Full Stack Web Developer Technologies
	</h2>
	<p>
		Full Stack Development involves developing and designing the following
		three layers:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Front-End Layer
		</li>
		<li>
			Back-End Layer
		</li>
		<li>
			Database Layer
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>
		Front End Layer
	</h3>
	<p>
		The front-end layer helps you interact with the web, watch videos,
		perform actions like register to an online shopping site. So basically,
		the design, look and feel of the web is accomplished with the help of
		HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		<br/>
		Let’s talk a little bit about front end technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Being proficient in languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript is the most
		basic requirement for becoming a Full Stack Developer.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language is the skeleton of
			every web page. By using HTML you tell the browser how you want
			your content to be structured by defining the different parts of a
			web page.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To learn more about HTML, you can go through this video by our Web
		Development experts.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets is used for styling the
			HTML elements. It provides 1000s of styling functions which are
			used to style the HTML elements defined by us.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To learn more about CSS, you can go through this video by our Web
		Development specialists.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language used to make the
			web look for alive. All the motions and graphics that you see on a
			website is done by using JavaScript.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		JavaScript Frameworks
		<br/>
		Having knowledge of the above-mentioned languages is not enough.
		Websites and web applications these days have integrated, complex, and
		interactive UIs which attract more traffic. To accomplish this, it is
		necessary to know the various JavaScript Frameworks and libraries like
		Angular, React, VueJs, Ember, NodeJs, jQuery, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are 100s of JavaScript frameworks that will help you with web
		development, but it’s often confusing to choose among so many
		well-versed frameworks.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Back End Layer
	</h3>
	<p>
		The back-end layer forms a dynamic connection between the front-end and
		the database. To get this layer working it’s important to know at least
		one of the programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, etc
		and knowledge of server-side frameworks such as NodeJS is mandatory.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Python is an open-source, object-oriented programming language that
			was released in 1991 and ever since it has become one of the
			favorite languages of most software and web developers.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Java is an open-source, a high-level programming language that was
			released by Sun Microsystems in 1996. It follows the Write Once Run
			Anywhere (WORA) approach that makes it compatible to run on any
			platform.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			PHP is an open-source, server-side scripting language used to
			develop the back-end logic of an application. It is a powerful tool
			for making dynamic and interactive websites.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			NodeJS is an open-source, JavaScript framework used specifically
			for creating the back end or the server-side of an application.
			Through NodeJS, JavaScript can now finally run on the server-side
			of the web.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
		Database Layer
	</h3>
	<p>
		The data layer is a massive warehouse of information. It contains a
		database repository which captures and stores information from the
		front-end, through the back-end. A prerequisite is to have knowledge of
		how data is stored, edited, retrieved, etc. An understanding of
		Databases such as MySQL, MongoDB is a must.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			MySQL is an open-source, Relational Database Management System that
			provides multi-user access and supports multi storage engines.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			MongoDB is known for its ease of use and its quickness in handling
			large amount of data. It is an open source, object-oriented, NoSQL
			database which is highly scalable and is efficient in handling
			unstructured data.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In addition to the above-mentioned technologies, a Full Stack Web
		Developer must know the different parts of the web, one must have a
		good understanding of web architecture and the various communication
		protocols like HTTP, he must also be familiar with Version Control
		Systems and Project Management tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		Becoming a Full Stack Web Developer requires a good amount of effort
		and dedication. But is it worth all the effort? Yes, it definitely is.
		It is the most valued designation and once you practice Full Stack Web
		Development, you’ll become a master of the web.
