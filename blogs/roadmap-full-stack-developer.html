	<p>Become a Full Stack Developer: In this video we will see how a beginner can become a full stack web developer in
		a very short timespan.

		Full stack developers are developers who work with both the front and back end of a website or application.
		They’re familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one or more backend languages. Hence the term “full
		stack”—they’ve got all the web development skills to build sites and apps from start to finish.</p>
