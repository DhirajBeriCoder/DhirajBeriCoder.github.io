<p>

	Make sure you watch this video till the end because I will be sharing with

	you a lot of secrets that I’ve learned of doing affiliate marketing for

	over seven years.

</p>

<p>

	Well who am I to even teach you affiliate marketing, right? Well I have

	been doing affiliate marketing for over seven years now, and I have a

	portfolio of over 11+ websites, apart from that I also do paid consulting,

	I’m a speaker and a trainer.

</p>

<p>

	And now comes the big question, what is affiliate marketing? In affiliate

	marketing, three parties are involved. There’s a merchant or an affiliate

	network, let’s consider it to be Amazon. Then there will be you, as an

	affiliate. Where you'll be promoting the products of the merchant through a

	special affiliate link. So, when someone purchases a product through your

	affiliate link, you get a commission, that is, you make money.

</p>

<p>

	Now in my affiliate marketing blog series, I’ll show you step-by-step on

	how to sign up to the affiliate network, how to generate your links, how to

	promote these links to thousands of people for free and then make money

	from your links.

</p>

<p>

	Almost all popular companies use affiliate marketing to drive customers. Be

	it Amazon, Flipkart, Ola, Uber, Swiggy, FoodPanda, Zomato- almost all

	popular companies are doing it.

</p>

<p>

	But the important question is, how affiliate marketing will help you. Well

	the most important benefit is certainly online earning on autopilot. Today

	my websites are driving free traffic every month from Google and making me

	affiliate commission.

</p>

<p>

	So now let’s talk about who can learn affiliate marketing. You don’t need

	any special qualifications, you don’t need any technical background. All

	you need is one laptop, or a computer, and an internet connection. This is

	all you need.

</p>

<p>

	The best part about affiliate marketing is that you are making money from

	the comfort of your home. There is no age limit, no massive course fee,

	only your willingness to learn, and your willingness to earn money online.

</p>

<p>

	I’m friends with people who are making $100,000 per month to $300,000 per

	month from affiliate marketing.

</p>

<p>

	So now let’s talk about what is the best way to learn affiliate marketing.

	Well when I started there was no one to guide me. No one to tell me the

	best tips, tricks, tools or strategies that actually work. Well lucky for

	you, I’ll be teaching you and guiding you in every step. You need a guide,

	a person who has made the mistakes, so that you don’t repeat those

	mistakes.

</p>

<p>

	So now let’s mention which affiliate network to specialise in . There are

	thousands of affiliate networks in the market. I myself use 50+ affiliate

	networks to form money for my affiliate websites.

</p>

<p>

	So which one should you choose? While there are more complicated ones like

	Clickbank and the Commission Junction, where you need the knowledge of

	advanced digital marketing in order to make money. This is because the

	competition is just way to high.

</p>

<p>

	For beginners, who are just starting out, the one i like to recommend is

	Amazon Associate. It’s easy to run and promote and now I’ll be showing you

	why you should be focusing only on Amazon.in. Amazon is the world’s biggest

	ecommerce website. Amazon.com is driving more than 2.5B visitors per month.

	Amazon India or Amazon.in is driving quite 360M people per month.

</p>

<p>

	The best part is that each experienced affiliate marketer is merely

	targeting Amazon.com within the US market. But there’s usually zero

	competition in Amazon India. So, making money from an Indian Amazon

	associate account is a hundred times easier than promoting in Amazon.com on

	the US market.

</p>

<p>

	Apart from this, there is many other reasons why you should join the Amazon

	affiliate network. Once you promote your Amazon affiliate link the cookie

	period is for twenty-four hours. So, regardless of the customer finishes up

	purchasing within the next 24 hours, you'll be getting the commission for

	that.

</p>

<p>

	The second good point is that you will be getting paid the affiliate

	commission for the entire cart. So, let’s say you refer someone to buy a

	t-shirt. But the person ends up buying a jean, a cap and the t-shirt as

	well. You will be getting the affiliate commission for the whole cart value

	and not just the merchandise that you simply recommend. This is the

	simplest part about the Amazon affiliate link.

</p>

<p>

	And since Amazon has such a lot data and optimization, majority of the

	people find yourself buying numerous other products and not just the

	merchandise you recommend. You can see in the image on the screen that

	majority of the products that I sold are not the products that I was

	promoting but the other products that people purchased when I referred them

	and I still got the commission.

</p>

<p>

	The third benefit is the Amazon brand. Amazon is now one of the biggest

	ecommerce websites in India. They spend millions in advertising and now

	everyone knows about Amazon. So, there’s a trust from the consumers from

	Amazon, so the conversion rate of people buying from Amazon is very high.

</p>

<p>

	This also helps in getting more sales and hence, making more affiliate

	commissions. I am getting a massive 3.5% conversion rate. So, every hundred

	people I ask Amazon, almost 3 – 4 people find yourself buying the products.

	So that’s just amazing.

</p>

<p>

	So now let’s talk about how can you make money from affiliate marketing.

	The easy answer is creating a website and scale it. Don’t worry, I won’t

	just tell you this and end the blog, in our next lesson of our affiliate

	marketing playlist, I will tell you how to select a profitable niche.

</p>

<p>

	In lesson three I’ll show you a step-by-step in how to create an Amazon

	affiliate website like a pro. I will be sharing all my strategies that I’ve

	learned in the last 7 years of building and scaling affiliate websites. So,

	make sure you watch our complete series.
